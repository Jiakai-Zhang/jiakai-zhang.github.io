<!-- ![Cover](/images/IMG_1629.jpeg) -->

I am a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate at VRVC Lab, [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Jingyi Yu](http://www.yu-jingyi.com/cv/). Also, I am a co-founder & CEO of a startup, [Cellverse(寰渺科技)](https://www.cellverse.tech), focusing on protein-centric AI technology research & development. Before that, I majored in Computer Science at ShanghaiTech University. In the summer of 2022, I joined [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/) as a research scientist intern in Redmond, WA. I am familiar with 3D scene reconstruction via implicit neural representations such as NeRF and 3D Gaussians. Currently, I am focusing on 4D protein reconstruction and protein design.

<!-- ![Cover](/images/IMG_1629.jpeg) -->

I am a last-year Ph.D. candidate at VRVC Lab, [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Jingyi Yu](http://www.yu-jingyi.com/cv/). In the summer of 2022, I joined [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/) as a research scientist intern in Redmond, WA. 

My research interests lie in interdisciplinary reconstruction & generation tasks (e.g., dynamic human, spectrum, and protein) using neural representations. Currently, I am focusing on AI applications in protein-centric tasks, particularly for Cryo-EM, via foundation models and generative models.

I have also served as a reviewer for top conferences, including CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, NeurIPS, and SIGGRAPH.

Beyond academia, I co-founded a startup, [Cellverse(寰渺科技)](https://www.cellverse.tech) for developing protein-centric AI applications.

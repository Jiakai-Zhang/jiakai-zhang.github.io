I am the second-year graduate student and expected PhD student at VRVC Lab, [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Jingyi Yu](http://www.yu-jingyi.com/cv/). I also obtained my B.E. in **Computer Science and Technology** at ShanghaiTech University. At Summer 2022, I will join [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/) as a **research scientist intern** for six months located in Redmond, WA. I am passionate and interested in essential **4D reconstruction & rendering** tasks in Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Bioinformatics fields.

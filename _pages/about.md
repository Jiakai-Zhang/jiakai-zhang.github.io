I am the 3rd year Ph.D. candidate at VRVC Lab, [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Jingyi Yu](http://www.yu-jingyi.com/cv/). I also obtained my B.E. in **Computer Science and Technology** at ShanghaiTech University. Now I join [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/) as a **research scientist intern** for six months located in Redmond, WA. I am passionate and interested in essential **4D reconstruction & rendering** tasks in Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Bioinformatics fields.

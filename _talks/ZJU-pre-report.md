I was invited to give a presentation of my paper [Editable Free-viewpoint Video using a layered Neural Representation](https://jiakai-zhang.github.io/st-nerf) by [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html).

I learned about many interesting and exciting researching areas, met some lovely friends and spent a great time there.
